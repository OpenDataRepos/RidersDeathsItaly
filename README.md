An article from "Wired.it" [1] states that in Italy currently there is no database about food delivery riders' casualties. 

The table in the Google Sheet below [2] is an attempt to address this.

This table is being built over time, and does not come with any guarantee of completeness or accuracy. Any feedback remains welcome. 

TODO: 
- Search more data from 2020 and pre-2017 
- QA
- Check spelling and grammar 
- Understand how the professional figure's name has changed over time (e.g., from 'pony-express' and 'fattorino' to 'rider')
